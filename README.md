# 🧠 Nutrition Agent – IBM Watsonx Studio Project

An AI-powered virtual assistant that helps users make smarter nutrition decisions using the capabilities of IBM Watsonx Studio on IBM Cloud.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is developed as part of IBM's AI internship training, where a **Nutrition Agent** was built using **Watsonx.ai**, utilizing prompt engineering and natural language processing to answer food and health-related queries.

## 🌐 Technologies Used

- IBM Watsonx.ai Studio (Prompt-based AI)
- IBM Cloud
- AI Foundation Models (Granite Family)
- Python (optional for integration)
- CSV for Nutrition Dataset

## 🗂️ Folder Breakdown

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `watsonx/` | Contains prompt files, screenshots of deployment, and configurations |
| `datasets/` | Sample nutrition data used to support prompts |
| `notebooks/` | IBM Watsonx notebooks (Python + Prompt Engineering) |
| `assets/` | Demo videos or GIFs for visual presentation |

## 📝 How It Works

1. **Prompt Design:** A custom prompt was crafted to guide the agent in answering user queries about calories, healthy meals, and diet tips.
2. **Model Used:** Granite-13b-instruct-v2 (or similar, based on Watsonx deployment).
3. **Deployment:** The agent was tested within the Watsonx prompt lab and integrated into a simple Python or web interface (optional).
