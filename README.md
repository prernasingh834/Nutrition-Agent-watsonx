🥗 Nutrition Agent – Powered by WatsonX (IBM Cloud)

🚀 Project Overview

Nutrition Agent is an AI-powered virtual assistant designed to help users make informed dietary choices, track their nutrition, and promote healthier lifestyles. It utilizes IBM’s WatsonX Assistant to engage users through natural language and provide personalized dietary recommendations, nutritional facts, meal suggestions, and more.

Developed during the IBM & Edunet Foundation Internship, this project integrates advanced AI capabilities into a simple, interactive chatbot interface that makes nutritional support accessible to all.

This is a simple AI Nutrition Assistant built using **IBM Watsonx Studio**. The assistant provides personalized nutritional suggestions and insights using AI prompt engineering.
